# Random Wiki

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/ee0b7064085a444bad97d007e1766077)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/hieunlt/random-wiki?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=hieunlt/random-wiki&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Wikipedia, the largest and most-read reference work in history, has an API that provides cacheable and straightforward access to Wikimedia content and data, in machine-readable formats. I utilized this API to create a simple TUI client that fetches a random Wikipedia article summary along with the link to the full content should it interest the user. This project is written in `Rust` using the `cursive` library
